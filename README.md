# PyBer_Analysis

## Analysis Overview

- Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.
- Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
- Summarizes how data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

It is not a secret that rural cities do not have such a high margin of use in this type of trip platform, as we can see in the graph below, the lowest profits correspond to these types of cities.

Now, let's check bellow chart. As we can notice, rural fares are higher than urban ones but with lower volume. Suburban, on the other hand, have an unexpected low fares considering this kind of cities have a great population density. These cities are constantly growing and during the last few years, suburban cities have grown exponentially.
Urban cities results are expected, this kind of cities are bigger, population is very familiarize with this kind of apps, they are constantly looking for new and better ways to make their lifestyle easy.

In order to create new strategies we could see bellow graph wich will help us to better dimention the PyBer performance in each city type:

## Summary

Based on last information we propouse bellow strategies: 

1. To create a marketing campaing focus on suburban and rural cities, based on their needs and trying to help in little day by day struggles that PyBer could solved as little deliveries for local businesses or or shared rides with other locals. 
2. Create an attachement campaing for Urban cities so PyBer could be fastly positioned in the best rated app and getting more attached clients that only use this platform. 
3. To create  an attachment system for drivers in rural and suburban cities, this way, disponibility and more trip agility will increase not only the volume but the fares due to this population get attached to brand and develop fidelity to the app.
